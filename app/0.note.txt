If you are running on Python 3, please consider to downgrade pip package using command below:

	python -m pip install --user --upgrade pip==9.0.3

and run "setup.py" and "slope_stability_scanner.py" squently to begin the program.

Or if you want to install the required packages manually, you can use this command:

	pip3 install pyfiglet, pandas, numpy

and make sure your computer has been installed the latest version of pip3.
